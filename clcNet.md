# clcNet: Improving the Efficiency of Convolutional Neural Network using Channel Local Convolutions

### I. Introduction
*  how to improve the computational and memory efﬁciency of CNN has become an important research topic in the ﬁeld of deep learning.
*  This paper attempts to provide a generalized view about depthwise convolution and grouped convolution through a concept named channel local convolution, where the computation of an output channel only depends on a subset of its input channels
*
